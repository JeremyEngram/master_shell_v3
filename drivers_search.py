To create a Linux systemd service 
that automatically backs up files 
from any Android device connected 
via USB and automounts all devices 
by default, you can follow these 
steps: 1. **Create a udev rule:** 
Create a udev rule to trigger the 
backup service when an Android 
device is connected via USB. Open 
a terminal and create a file named 
`/etc/udev/rules.d/99-android-backup.rules` 
with the following content:
   ``` SUBSYSTEM=="usb", 
   ATTR{idVendor}=="YOUR_VENDOR_ID", 
   ACTION=="add", 
   RUN+="/usr/bin/systemctl start 
   android-backup.service" ``` 
   Replace `YOUR_VENDOR_ID` with 
   the actual vendor ID of your 
   Android device. You can find 
   the vendor ID by running the 
   command `lsusb` when the device 
   is connected and looking for 
   the corresponding line.
2. **Create the backup script:** 
Create a backup script that 
performs the backup operation. 
Open a terminal and create a file 
named 
`/usr/local/bin/android-backup.sh` 
with the following content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup/directory"
   # Mount the Android device
   mtpfs -o allow_other 
   /mnt/android
   # Perform the backup operation 
   # (replace with your backup 
   # logic)
   rsync -av /mnt/android/ 
   "$BACKUP_DIR"
   # Unmount the Android device
   fusermount -u /mnt/android ``` 
   Replace 
   `/path/to/backup/directory` 
   with the actual path to the 
   directory where you want to 
   store the backup files. Make 
   the script executable by 
   running the command: ```bash 
   chmod +x 
   /usr/local/bin/android-backup.sh 
   ```
3. **Create the systemd service:** 
Create a systemd service unit file 
to manage the backup service. Open 
a terminal and create a file named 
`/etc/systemd/system/android-backup.service` 
with the following content:
   ``` [Unit] Description=Android 
   Backup Service 
   Wants=android-backup-devices.target 
   After=android-backup-devices.target 
   [Service] 
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/android-backup.sh 
   [Install] 
   WantedBy=multi-user.target ```
4. **Create the systemd target 
unit:** Create a systemd target 
unit file to manage the 
automounting of Android devices. 
Open a terminal and create a file 
named 
`/etc/systemd/system/android-backup-devices.target` 
with the following content:
   ``` [Unit] Description=Android 
   Backup Devices [Install] 
   WantedBy=multi-user.target ```
5. **Enable and start the 
service:** Enable and start the 
backup service and target by 
running the following commands:
   ```bash systemctl enable 
   android-backup.service 
   systemctl enable 
   android-backup-devices.target 
   systemctl start 
   android-backup-devices.target 
   ``` This will ensure that the 
   backup service starts when an 
   Android device is connected via 
   USB.
Now, whenever an Android device 
with the specified vendor ID is 
connected via USB, the udev rule 
will trigger the 
`android-backup.service` service. 
This service will then mount the 
device, perform the backup 
operation using the script, and 
unmount the device after the 
backup is complete. Remember to 
replace 
`/path/to/backup/directory` with 
the actual backup directory path 
and adjust the backup logic in the 
script 
(`/usr/local/bin/android-backup.sh`) 
according to your requirements.
Note: Ensure that the necessary dependencies, such as `mtpfs`, are installed on your system for proper USB device handling and mounting.
